The _Scratch Pad_ is a space where you can work if you're not connected to kafkaman servers. When you aren't logged in or don't have a network connection, you can still access some kafkaman features offline, such as creating collections and requests, or sending requests.

All your work in the Scratch Pad is stored locally and isn't synced online with kafkaman. After working in the Scratch Pad, you can later move your work into a workspace once you log in.

## Entering the Scratch Pad

If you log out or your connection to kafkaman breaks, you'll see a global banner at the top of the screen indicating that you're already in the Scratch Pad.

If you are logged in and want to go to the Scratch Pad, select the gear icon <img alt="Settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/icon-gear-outline-v9.jpg" width="18px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:5px"> to the right side of the header toolbar and select **Scratch Pad**.

## Exporting data from the Scratch Pad

1. Choose a directory in which to save the file, then select **Save**.

You can also export a single collection or an environment. For more information, see [Exporting kafkaman data](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-kafkaman-data).
