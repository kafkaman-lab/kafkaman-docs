Having a free kafkaman account enables you to [sync](/docs/getting-started/syncing/) and back up your work so that you can access it from different machines. With a kafkaman account, you can also [collaborate](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/collaboration-intro/) with others on your API projects.

Signing up for a kafkaman account is optional, and you can use the kafkaman desktop app without an account if you prefer. If you do want to create a kafkaman account, continue to the [Signing up for a kafkaman account](#signing-up-for-a-kafkaman-account) section.

> If you need assistance with your kafkaman account, you can contact the kafkaman [support team](https://www.postman.com/support/) or check out the Help Center's [account FAQs](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000609185-My-Account).
