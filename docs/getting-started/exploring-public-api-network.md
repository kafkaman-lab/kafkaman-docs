The kafkaman Public API Network is the largest network of APIs, workspaces, and collections by developers across the planet. Many of the teams and companies responsible for leading-edge APIs and technologies have public workspaces you can explore. Popular third-party APIs are also published, along with examples you can use as a starting point when writing your own APIs or collections.

To access the Public API Network, visit [kafkaman.com/explore](https://www.kafkaman.com/explore) or select **Explore** at the top left of kafkaman.

There are a variety of ways to find APIs, workspaces, teams, and collections:

* **Categories** showcases popular API categories in the Public API Network including Communication, Data Analytics, and Financial Services.
* **In the spotlight** highlights the latest exciting, useful, and noteworthy contributions to the Public API Network, handpicked by the experts at kafkaman.
* **Trending workspaces, collections, and APIs** shows entities that are the most popular in the Public API Network, based on the number of people viewing or creating forks of them.
* The **Search kafkaman** box at the top of the page searches all kafkaman teams, workspaces, collections, and APIs by default, but you can also use the search controls to limit a search to the Public API Network.
* Under **Browse**, you can select to view **Teams**, **Workspaces**, **APIs**, and **Collections**. You can sort results using the **Featured**, **Most Viewed**, and **Latest** tabs just below the header.
    * You can also sort Collections and Workspaces by category using the filters below the header.

To import a collection from a public workspace to your workspace, create a fork of it. See [forking a collection](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/version-control-for-collections/#forking-a-collection).
