## Billing dashboard

The kafkaman [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing) enables you to manage your team's billing.

### Viewing billing overview

When navigating to your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing), you will first see your billing overview. You can view the details of your kafkaman plan, including your subscription cycle and a calculation of your expected cost upon renewal.

<img alt="Billing overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/billing-plan-and-payments-dash-v9.1.jpg" />

### Managing add-ons

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing), select **Resource usage** on the left to view your team's usage of mock servers, monitoring, custom domains, the kafkaman API, serverless requests, integrations, and the cloud agent.

<img alt="Add-ons usage and purchase" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/resource-usage-9.13.jpg" />

> Select **View detailed usage** next to **Monitoring Usage** to view your team's active monitors and their impact on your team's overall usage during the current billing period.

You can opt to allow or disallow overages for mock server and monitor usage by selecting the icon to the right of each item. If enabled, you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

You can also [Purchase Add-ons](#purchasing-add-ons).

> If your API development pipeline is dependent on kafkaman monitoring, disabling overages may cause unintended consequences. To avoid this as well as potentially fluctuating pay-as-you-go charges, consider adding [pre-paid monitoring blocks](#purchasing-add-ons) to your team plan.

### Viewing account history

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **History**.

<img alt="Account history view" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/billing-history-v9.1.jpg" />

Items such as updates to your kafkaman subscription, card changes, payments, and charges are all listed in chronological order.

### Viewing past invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **Invoices**. You can get a copy of your past invoices by selecting the download icon to the right of the invoice you would like to retrieve.

<img alt="Invoices view" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/billing-invoices-v9.1.jpg" />

To add or edit the information on an invoice, see [adding custom information to invoices](#adding-custom-information-to-invoices).

## Payments

kafkaman offers various payment options dependent on your plan type.

### Managing cards

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **Payment methods**.

To add, select **Add Payment Method**.

To remove, hover over the card in question and select **Delete Payment Method**.

To set a card as your primary, hover over the card and **Set as Primary**.

<img alt="Payment methods view" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/payment-methods-page.jpg" />

### Paying by invoice

Invoicing is available for kafkaman Enterprise teams only. New customers can [contact the kafkaman Sales team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/get-started-kafkaman-plans/) to get started and will receive a response within 3 business days. Existing Enterprise customers can [submit a request](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us) to be invoiced instead of automatically charged.

You can pay invoices online, via ACH, or via wire-transfer. kafkaman sends invoices to the billing email address listed in your [billing details](http://go.kafkaman.co/settings/team/billing-details). The invoice includes offline payment instructions. View your pending payments in your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing).

### Adding custom information to invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **Invoices**. Select **Edit billing information**.

Add or update your company name, billing email, address, and your VAT ID if applicable, then select **Save**. All future [invoices](https://go.kafkaman.co/billing/invoices) will have the updated copy. To modify an existing invoice, submit a request to [kafkaman support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us).

<img alt="Edit billing details" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/update-billing-details-v9.jpg" width="500px"/>

### Failed payments

If you have a card on file, kafkaman will automatically attempt 3 times to charge it. If this is unsuccessful, team members with billing privileges receive an email notification.

<img alt="Failed payment email" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/billing-email-payment-declined-v9.1.jpg" width="400px"/>

If payment is unsuccessful, kafkaman offers a grace period of 21 days to avoid service disruption. For invoice-based teams, this means 21 days following the due date listed on the invoice.

> All team members receive a notification in the event of non-payment and service deactivation in kafkaman.

## Team and plan changes

You can change your team's plan and billing cycle in your [billing dashboard](https://go.kafkaman.co/billing/overview).

### Changing your plan

### Purchasing add-ons

The base number of monitoring requests, mock server calls, and custom domains included in your plan depends on your [plan type](https://www.postman.com/pricing).

Update the number of monitoring blocks, mock server blocks, and custom domains you would like to have included in your team plan, then select **Next** to confirm your changes.

### Utilizing auto-flex

[Auto-flex](https://learning.postman.com/auto-flex-policy/) is a flexible billing feature available to kafkaman teams. With auto-flex enabled, your team admins can add users without having to pay in advance for more seats. Instead, you can use auto-flex to see the value of adding users to your kafkaman team, and opt to retain or remove them before being [billed](#billing-for-auto-flex).

> Auto-flex is automatically enabled for all kafkaman Basic and Professional plans purchased after April 8, 2021. Teams created before this date can opt in by enabling auto-flex via their [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing). All teams will have auto-flex automatically enabled when their plan first renews after July 1, 2021.

#### Opting in to auto-flex

You can enable auto-flex for your team by navigating to your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing).

<img alt="Auto-flex opt in early notification" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/auto-flex-opt-in-notification-v9.1.jpg" />

Select **Get Early Access**.

<img alt="Auto-flex opt in confirmation" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/opt-in-to-auto-flex-modal.jpg" width="400px"/>

Select to **Agree to Auto-Flex's terms and conditions**, then select **Get Early Access**.

> View [kafkaman's auto-flex team policy](https://learning.postman.com/auto-flex-policy/).

#### Billing for auto-flex

Your auto-flex billing cycle is dependent on your team's plan:

* Monthly plans are charged for newly added users on a monthly basis.

* Annual plans are charged for newly added users on a quarterly basis.

At any time during your auto-flex billing cycle, team admins can add users to your team regardless of available seats.

Before your auto-flex billing cycle renews, all billing and admin team members receive a notification about any new users you added during that time period.

> Annual plans receive a notification two weeks before their quarterly cycle renews, and monthly plans receive a notification one week before their monthly cycle renews.

You can use this reminder to make any necessary changes to your team before the end of your current auto-flex cycle, when you will be billed for any newly added users.

> If you have already been billed for the users you added and retained in an earlier auto-flex cycle, you can't remove those slots until your plan renews.

You won't be billed if the number of users has remained unchanged during your auto-flex cycle, or if you remove any additional users prior to auto-flex billing.

> If your team incurs any overages and you have an auto-flex bill for that cycle, your invoice will combine your overage charges with your auto-flex charges.

<img alt="Auto-flex email notification" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/auto-flex-email-notification-9.13.jpg" width="400px"/>

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.kafkaman.co/billing), you can view:

* Your current number of additional team members
* How much you will be billed at the end of your cycle (unless you add or remove team members in the interim)
* Additional information about your auto-flex and regular billing cycles

<img alt="Billing overview with auto flex" src="https://assets.postman.com/kafkaman-docs/auto-flex-dash-9.13.jpg" />

> [Contact kafkaman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) with any questions about auto-flex.
