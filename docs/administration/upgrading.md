This section describes the steps to migrate your team to the latest version of kafkaman.

kafkaman v9 provides a consistent, improved API development experience. The kafkaman desktop app and [kafkaman on the web](https://community.kafkaman.com/t/whats-new-in-kafkaman-for-the-web/18203) are equally empoweringâ€”which one you use is a matter of preference for your workflows.

### Upgrading to v8 as a team
