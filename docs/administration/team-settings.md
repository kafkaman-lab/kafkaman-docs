## Editing your team profile

When you select **Team Settings**, you will be automatically directed to **Team Profile**. Here, you can edit your team's logo, cover photo, domain, favicon, and profile visibility.

**Customize your team's look.** Keep in mind the following when uploading a logo, cover photo, or favicon:

* Logos and cover photos must be 500 KB or less in size and must be in **.jpg**, **.jpeg**, or **.png** format.
* Logos must have a 1:1 aspect ratio (height:width), and cover photos must have a 1:7.5 aspect ratio. If your image has a different aspect ratio, kafkaman prompts you to select a portion of your image to display.
* Favicons must be in **.ico** format, no larger than 32x32 pixels, and 500 KB or less in size. Your favicon is displayed on the browser tab of your team's published documentation site.

**Make your team discoverable.** If you enable your team's public profile, your team will be visible on kafkaman's [API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/adding-private-network/), along with any [APIs](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/adding-private-network/#adding-your-apis), [collections](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/), and [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/public-workspaces/) your team has published. You can also add an **About your team** section, a link to your website, and links to social media accounts to your team's public profile.

## Making your team discoverable

You can select **Team Discovery** from the left-hand menu to view your options for making your team discoverable to other kafkaman users with email addresses from your team's domain.

See [Team Discovery](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/collaboration-intro/#team-discovery) for more information on this feature and the admin and user experience it provides.
