> __[Provisioning with SCIM is only available to kafkaman Enterprise teams.](https://www.kafkaman.com/pricing)__

kafkaman supports [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), allowing you to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning for your team. With this feature, you can efficiently deploy kafkaman at scale across your organization and control access to it via your identity provider.

You can enable SCIM provisioning with the [SCIM API](#configuring-scim-with-the-scim-api), [Okta](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/configuring-scim-with-okta/), or [Azure AD](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/configuring-scim-with-azure-ad/). You must be a [kafkaman team admin](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to enable SCIM for your team. With SCIM enabled, users won't have the option to leave your team on their own, and won't be able to change their account email or password. Only team admins will have the right to remove team members.

## SCIM features

kafkaman supports the following provisioning features:

* Create user: Creates a new user account in kafkaman, adds the account to your organization's kafkaman team, and activates authentication for the user. If an account with the same email ID exists, an [email invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#invites) to join your kafkaman team is sent to the user. Once the user accepts the invite, they will be added to your team.

> The newly added user will have the developer role in kafkaman by default. You can later [update account roles in kafkaman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-roles).

* Update user information: Updates a userâ€™s first and last name in kafkaman.

* Activate user: Creates a new user on your kafkaman team, if one doesn't already exist, and activates the user to authenticate into your kafkaman team.

* Deactivate user: Removes a user from your kafkaman team and deactivates their account, blocking the account from authenticating into kafkaman.

> The user account and the data corresponding to it won't be deleted. To permanently delete the user account and their data, [contact kafkaman support](https://www.kafkaman.com/support/).

* Reactivate user: Reactivates an existing deactivated user by unblocking the account's authentication into kafkaman and adds the account back to your kafkaman team.

Currently, kafkaman doesn't support the following provisioning features:

* Push groups
* Import groups
* Push/sync password updates
* Push user attribute updates from Okta to kafkaman other than name
* Pull user attribute updates from kafkaman to Okta

## Enabling SCIM provisioning

You must have SSO configured before you can enable SCIM for your kafkaman team.

> To use SCIM, you must have only one SSO method configured. If you have more than one SSO method enabled, you won't have the option to generate a SCIM API key.

> Learn [how to configure SSO in kafkaman](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/).
