> Certain team options are only available on **[kafkaman Basic, Professional, and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**. To see which roles are available on your plan, go to your **[web dashboard](https://go.kafkaman.co/settings/team/roles)**.

Roles determine user permissions within a kafkaman team and a user's level of access to a kafkaman element, like a collection or an API.

## Team roles

As a team admin, you have the power to define kafkaman access at the team level. You can use kafkaman's role-based access control system to limit visibility of team resources, define your development workflow, and provide access to administrative and billing personnel. Each user on a team must have at least one role attached to them, and can hold multiple roles simultaneously.

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/) one or more role types to your team members, based on the functions those team members require:

* **Super Admin**: Manages everything within a team, including team settings, members, roles, and resources in [public, team, or private workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#changing-workspace-visibility). Team members with this role can perform all actions that Admin, Billing, Community Manager, and Developer roles can perform ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)).
* **Admin**: Manages team members and team settings.
* **Billing**: Manages team plan and payments. Billing roles can be granted by a Super Admin, by a fellow team member with a Billing role, or by an Admin when inviting a new team member. If this is not possible, contact our [Support Center](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us).
* **Developer**: Has access to all team resources and workspaces.
* **Community Manager**: Manages the public visibility of workspaces and team profile ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)).

> If you are on a [kafkaman Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can also assign roles at the [group level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).

Team roles provide high-level access control:

&ast; On kafkaman Basic and Free plans, any developer can change visibility of workspaces

&ast;&ast; Enterprise and Professional plans only

> **kafkaman support users**. Members with a Developer or Super Admin role consume a paid slot on your team. Team members who have only Admin or Billing roles become support users and donâ€™t consume paid slots. Your team can have two support users.

### Managing team roles

To learn how to manage team roles in kafkaman, see [Managing your team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/).

## Workspace roles

You can [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#managing-workspace-roles) three role types in kafkaman workspaces: **Admin**, **Editor**, and **Viewer**.

* **Editor:** Can create and edit workspace resources
* **Viewer:** Can view, fork, and export workspace resources

The following roles control access at a workspace level:

| Action | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Join and leave workspaces | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714; |
| Send requests | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714; |
