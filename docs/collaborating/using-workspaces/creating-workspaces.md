Workspaces allow you to organize your kafkaman work and collaborate with teammates. You can group your projects together, with workspace acting as the single source of truth for related APIs, collections, environments, mocks, monitors, and other linked entities. By collaborating in a workspace, your edits are synced with your team in realtime.

Personal workspaces are visible only to youâ€”with a [kafkaman account](/docs/getting-started/kafkaman-account/) you can create unlimited workspaces. With team workspaces, you can share and manage access to project components with collaborators. [Public workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/public-workspaces/) enable you to collaborate on entities with anyone across the world.

By adding an entity such as a collection to a workspace, collaborators with access to the workspace will also be able to access the entity by default with read-only permissions. You can [configure access settings](/docs/collaborating-in-kafkaman/roles-and-permissions/) for the workspace on an individual basis to provide permissions depending on your account.

Workspaces can also create visibility for the projects within a team, as collections in a workspace are visible to all members with access to the workspace. Request history is also saved to a workspace, which can aid collaborative debugging efforts.

_Workspace as an entity_ represents a whole container where being an admin gives you full access to the workspace. This concept works like the inheritance property where you will have editor access to all the elements within that particular workspace.

> For kafkaman Professional and Enterprise teams, a private workspace is a team workspace that is only visible to the user who created it, plus team members who have been invited to join it. Private workspaces allow teams to restrict access to collections, environments, mocks, and monitors that are relevant only to a particular group.

## Creating a new workspace

To create a new workspace, select the workspace dropdown menu at the left of kafkaman, and select **Create Workspace**.
